# Tara App (QR and Barcode scanning based Shopping App)

Market App is a mobile application that revolutionizes the shopping experience by enabling users to enter and leave stores using QR codes, scan product barcodes, and make online payments directly from their phones. This app eliminates the need for traditional checkout processes, saving time, and ensuring contactless transactions, especially in situations like pandemics where maintaining social distance is crucial.

- For the front-end part of the application, please refer to the **[Tara Mobile Frontend](https://github.com/Onurhnf/tara-mobile-frontend-reactnative-nativebase) repository**.

## Features

- Users can register and log in to the application.
- Users can scan QR codes at store entrances to access the virtual cart.
- Users can scan product barcodes to view detailed product information.
- Users can add desired items to the cart and manage their carts.
- Users can securely complete payment transactions within the app. (not implemented)
- Users can track their orders and view past order history.

## Payment Functionality

Please note that the current version of the back-end repository does not include the implementation of payment functionality. If you wish to integrate payment features into your application, you will need to implement the necessary code and configuration to connect with a payment gateway of your choice.
